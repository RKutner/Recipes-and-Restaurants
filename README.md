# Recipes-and-Restaurants

A web app to help users decide if they should eat at home or out and about by providing them with both a set of recipes and a list of restaurants that are nearby. Clicking the button on the recipe list will bring up a modal that provides the user with the actual recipe as well as the ingredient list. The restuarant half will load pins with the locations of nearby restuarants that have the searched food. There is a list button that provides more details regarding the food selected.
